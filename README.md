## Purpose: 
What is one thing everyone does every day? That's right, use the bathroom! So would it be too much to ask for our community to have a general idea of what a bathroom is like before walking in? Our group doesn‚Äôt think so, so we came up with the ‚ÄúRestroom Reports‚Äù project. Our project provides an interactive environment for users to read and share reviews of the various bathrooms at UGA. Users are able to use the interactive map to locate bathrooms near them, and post a review and description for future bathroom-goers to use as reference. We believe this will help our community by providing a more comfortable and personalized bathroom experience and help eliminate the dreadful hunt for the best ‚Äúspot‚Äù. Not to mention avoiding the stinky bad bathrooms üí©.  Say goodbye to blind dates with bathrooms, and hello to ‚ÄúRestroom Reports‚Äù. 

## Tools Utilized: 
- MongoDB Atlas 
- Express.js
- React 
- Node.js 
- Google Maps JavaScript API
- Npm docs
- VSCode
- GitHub/Git

## Problems that we ran into and overcame: 
- Linking the front end and the back end of the project together caused some confusing errors. We were able to overcome this by taking it slowly one error at a time and thinking through solutions. 
- Linking the HTML and React to java script functions in order to run them when needed. This was overcome by critical thinking and trial and error. 
- Creating an interactive map with specific bathroom points was challenging when trying to integrate the google maps API and getting the points to hold their position on the map. We were able to overcome this with research on the topic and trial and error while working together.
